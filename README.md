Here is a README for your Fake Currency Detection project:  

Fake Currency Detection is an AI-based system that uses machine learning algorithms to detect counterfeit currency notes. The system analyzes the features of currency notes and classifies them as real or fake based on pre-trained models.  

🚀 Features  
✅ Currency Note Classification: Detects whether a currency note is real or fake.  
✅ Multiple Currency Support: Works with various currencies (e.g., USD, INR, EUR).  
✅ Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a trained machine learning model to classify the authenticity of currency notes.   
✅ Real-Time Detection: Capable of processing images in real-time using a camera.  
✅ User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive interface to upload images for analysis.  

🛠️ Tech Stack  
Backend:  
Python
OpenCV (for image processing)  
TensorFlow / Keras (for machine learning model)  
scikit-learn (for machine learning)  
NumPy (for numerical operations)  

Frontend:  
Flask (web framework for UI)  
HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for interface)  

Database:  
SQLite (optional, for storing results)  

📦 Installation 
Follow the steps below to get the project up and running on your local machine.  

1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
git clone https://github.com/ZaBy10/Fake-Currency-Detection.git  
cd Fake-Currency-Detection  

2️⃣ Set Up a Virtual Environment  
python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux  
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows  

3️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt  

4️⃣ Train the Model (Optional)  
If you want to train the model from scratch, run the following:  
python train_model.py  

5️⃣ Run the Appl  ication  
python app.py
The application will run locally at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.  

📊 Usage  
1️⃣ Upload an Image – Upload an image of a currency note.  

2️⃣ Analyze – The system will classify the currency note as real or fake using the pre-trained model.  

3️⃣ View Results – Results will be displayed along with a confidence score.
